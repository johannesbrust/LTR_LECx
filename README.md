Large-Scale Trust-Region Methods For Linear Equality Constrained Optimization

MATLAB codes

This project contains the implementations of the Algorithms from the article
"Large-Scale Quasi-Newton Trust-Region Methods With Low Dimensional Linear-
Equality Constraints", J.J. Brust, R.F. Marcia, C.G. Petra, 2018.

The folders comprising this project are:

1. 	main: Implementations of Algorithm 1, and Algorithm 2.
2. 	auxiliary: General auxiliary routines.
3.	solvers: External Algorithms for comparisons.
4. 	netlib: Problems from netlib (.mps) format, and routine to read mps into
		MATLAB.
5. 	tests: Numerical experiments, described in the article.
6. 	data: Data generated by running the experiments.
7.	figs: Figures generated by the experiments, and used in the article.
